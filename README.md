# DMZ_ITR_Cohesotaxis_Intercalation

Simulations of Xenopus laevis mesendoderm migration during gastrulation using CompuCell3D.

Includes the following models:

DMZ - CC3D model representing leader and follower cells in a Dorsal Marginal Zone explant

4_DMZ_Base - CC3D model representing the In "The Round" (ITR) configuration

4_DMZ_Intercalation - CC3D model representing the ITR configuration with rules that allow for cell rearrangement to occur, producing cell intercalation
